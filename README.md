  # javascript
 Its swapna(commonly kmown as sapna) here i am starting a journey towards javascript. 
 I have a habit that if i start something i need to know the background to it like how it started, what the reason behind its invention and so.
 Today i went through and got to know about is Introduction to javascript, the basic concepts of javascript and the history of javascript.
 I have even enrolled before to one of the course our lead sended which is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/ in what i have started to do 
 projects from two days.
 I have done a crash coure before on javascript from udemy which is helping me to understand the basic terminology of javascript.
 i even started the video which was provided in our codechef domain group by one of our wellwisher.
 The plan for tomorrow javascript session is : I need to give min 2hr for it and try to go through practical parts of javascript in detail.
 Built my basics in javascript practicals.
